  ## AntiCheat
  I have been banned with this on one account after raging (and I'm pretty sure I was reported). However after playing normally on another account I have gone through 20 rounds of various games modes without a ban. Just don't be stupid and you should be fine. I have also inserted some code that I think will kill the program if FF is going to take a SS but I don't know if it works as I have not been banned yet.
